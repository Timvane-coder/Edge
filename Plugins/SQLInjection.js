*🛠️ SQL Injection (SQLi) Explained 🛠️*

*🔍 What is SQL Injection?*
SQL Injection (SQLi) is a type of attack that allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code on a database. This is usually done by inserting malicious SQL statements into an input field for execution by the database.

*📚 Example SQL Injection Attack:*
Consider a website login form that directly inserts user inputs into an SQL query:

\`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user' AND password = 'pass';\`

An attacker could enter:
\`' OR '1'='1\`
Resulting in:
\`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '' OR '1'='1';\`

This query always returns true, potentially granting unauthorized access.

*💬 WhatsApp Simulation:*
Imagine the same concept applied here. If this were a vulnerable platform, an attacker might try to manipulate database queries.

To stay safe:
- 📌 Always use prepared statements or parameterized queries.
- 🔒 Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- 📊 Implement proper error handling and logging.

*Stay safe and be aware of security best practices!*
