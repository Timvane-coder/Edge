  *💥 Denial of Service (DoS) Attack Explained 💥*
  
  *🔍 What is a DoS Attack?*
  A Denial of Service (DoS) attack aims to make a service unavailable by overwhelming it with a flood of requests.
  
  *📚 Example DoS Attack:*
  An attacker uses a script to send thousands of requests per second to a server, causing it to crash or become unresponsive.
  
  *💬 WhatsApp Simulation:*
  If this platform were vulnerable, an attacker could flood it with messages, causing it to slow down or crash.
  
  To stay safe:
- 🚧 Implement rate limiting.
- 🔥 Use firewalls to block malicious traffic.
- 🛡️ Monitor and mitigate traffic spikes.
  
  *Stay safe and be aware of security best practices!*
