    usage: ['Hi'], // Command usage trigger
    description: 'Say hello!', // Description of the command
    emoji: 'ðŸ‘‹', // Emoji associated with the command
    isGroupOnly: false, // Set to true if the command should only work in groups
    isChannelOnly: false, // Set to true if the command should only work in channels
    async execute(sock, m, args) {
        // The function to be executed when the command is called
        await hacxk.reply('Hello! ðŸ‘‹', m);
    }
};
```
